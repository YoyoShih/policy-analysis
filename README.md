# ActuaViz
I had been an intern of ActuaViz from 4/7/22 to 31/1/23, titled as "Actuarial Python Engineer".
This documentation is to explain these codes, and also record my thought for future development purpose.

## Background Knowledge Requirement
While reading or using these modules, the user would feel comfortable if having certain level knowledgement of actuarial science.
These knowledgement include:
* Survival models
* Life tables
* Insurance benifits
* Annuities
* Insurance premium calculation
* Policy value
* Other relevent knowledge of insurance
There are several teaching articles on my Medium as well as ActuaViz's.

## Contact Info
Feel free to read articles and contact me anytime if you have any questions.

## Files Structure
The main files are in the 7 folders, 6 for main codes and 1 for vital documents or outputs.
### Code Folders
* actuarial
    This folder contains essential actuarial logistics for insurance. It is seperated into two further folders.
    * functions
        This folder includes "py" files involving basic actuarial functions that would be repeatly called in modules.
        Annuity.py: it includes life contingent annuity functions such as lifetime annuity due or term annuity due.
